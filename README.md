# sssc
In this project, a SSSC (Static Synchronous Series Compensator) is implemented on MATLAB, along with its output waveform and RMS values.
The Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) is a reactive power series compensator employing a voltage source converter in series with the transmission line. This operating mode emulates a controlled series reactive compensation but provides a wider control range since it can operate equally in capacitive or inductive operating domains.
Its output is a series injected voltage, which leads or lags the line current by 90Â°, thus emulating a controllable inductive or capacitive reactance. The SSSC can be used to reduce or increase the equivalent line impedance and enhance the active power transfer capability of the line. Moreover, the SSSCs are highly controllable devices and can provide further functionalities and services to the energy system.

The SSSC works like the STATCOM, except that it is serially connected instead of a shunt.
